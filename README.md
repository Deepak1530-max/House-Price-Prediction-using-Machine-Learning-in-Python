# House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-in-Python

📌 Introduction
Predicting house prices accurately is crucial for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to estimate house prices based on features like lot size, building type, and construction year. It highlights how data-driven models can enhance accuracy and support real estate decision-making.

💡 Problem Statement
House prices are influenced by multiple factors such as location, size, and age of the property.
Traditional pricing methods can be subjective and inconsistent.
A machine learning-based solution can bring in objectivity, consistency, and higher accuracy in predictions.


🎯 Objectives
Build a machine learning model to predict housing prices based on historical data.
Apply preprocessing, feature selection, and evaluation techniques.
Compare multiple algorithms (Linear Regression, SVR, Random Forest) to identify the best-performing model.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like R² Score and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).


📊 Dataset

Lot size
Building type
Year built
Number of rooms
Sale price (target variable)
